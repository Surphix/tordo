# Setting up Environment Variables

Before running the application, make sure to set up the following environment variables:

- `TF_VAR_DO_TOKEN`: This environment variable should be set to your DigitalOcean API token. You can obtain this token from the DigitalOcean dashboard.
- `ORPORT`: This environment variable specifies the port number for your Tor relay's ORPort. This is the port on which your relay listens for incoming Tor connections.
- `OBFS4PORT`: This environment variable specifies the port number for your Tor relay's obfs4 transport. Obfs4 is a pluggable transport for Tor that provides additional obfuscation.
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: This environment variable should be set to the contact email address for the administrator or maintainer of the Tor relay.

Once you have set up these environment variables, you can proceed with running the application.
